# FDIDiagnosticAgent
The program FDIDiagnosticAgent is designed for express diagnostics of the cognitive style parameter on the scale 'field dependence/field independence' (FDI). Modification of the technique is a kind of perceptual tests. The program FDIDiagnosticAgent is an open source code in PHP and JavaScript, distributed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.

1. Users. The users of the program are specialists engaged in research on cognitive
activities in various professional fields, including in the field of education.

2. The program is designed for express diagnostics of the cognitive style parameter
on the scale 'field dependence/field independence' (FDI).
Modification of the technique is a kind of perceptual tests.

The parameter 'field independence/field dependence' is diagnosed, that is, structuring
ability in perception.
Fast and correct detection of detail in images is characterized by
'field independence', slow and erroneous - 'field dependence'.
The modified methodology includes 49 tasks, in each of which the person receiving
decision, it is necessary to solve the multinomial choice problem: 
find and select all images  (out of 4 answer options) which include (contain) 
the reference figure.
The left figure in each row of five images represents the desired (reference) figure. 
The task is to determine whether the desired figure is hidden in the four figures 
located on the right. 
The desired figure is must be rotated or scaled, but may be at a different level. 
The desired figure may include one drawing, two, three or all four.

3. Software implementation
To use the technique, a web browser that supports HTML 5 and Java Script is required.
To publish a modified FDI test on the Internet (intranet), you must
use hosting with support for PHP programs.

4. Author
The author of the FDIDiagnosticAgent project is Kotova Elena E., Associate Professor 
of the Department of Automation and management processes of St. Petersburg 
Electrotechnical University "LETI" and the Department of Clinical Psychology 
of St. Petersburg State Pediatric Medical University.

The co-author of the software implementation is Pisarev Andrey S., Associate Professor 
of the Department of Automation and management processes of St. Petersburg 
Electrotechnical University "LETI".

Automated modification of the methodology has been practically tested.
With the help of the methodology implemented in the program for 2015-2021 in testing,
participation of more than 800 people aged 17 to 25 years.
The results of the research made it possible to determine the individual parameters 
of cognitive potential on a scale of 'field dependence / field independence',
statistical characteristics of the parameter and its correlation with cognitive load and
success in solving perceptual-cognitive tasks.
Also, for the first time in automatic mode, the author obtained an exact solution 
to a series of tasks multinomial choice according to the modified FDI methodology using 
an intelligent software agent (IPA) CAPTCHA-E.

According to the results of testing, the IPA CAPTCHA-E demonstrated high 
perceptual-cognitive ability, characterized by the value of the cognitive profile parameter:
"very high level field independence".

The results of studies in which the software of the modified methods are presented in 
the publications of the authors.
